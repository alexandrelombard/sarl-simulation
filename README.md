# SARL simulation framework

## What is this framework offering?

This framework proposes generic purpose capacities that can be used to handle a simulation, including:
- The capacity to control the simulation
- The capacity to affect an agent to a body
- The capacity to propagate perceptions to the agents (from the simulation)
- The capacity to apply the influences of the agents (to the simulation)

A SimulationController behavior is also defined in order to run the simulation (i.e. collecting perceptions, applying the influences, 
running the simulation).

This framework does not depend on the way the simulation is implemented.
It does not make any assumption on the simulation environment.
